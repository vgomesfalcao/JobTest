# Fibonacci Search in Optimization of Unimodal Functions
This algorithm performs the Fibonacci Line Search to find the minimum of a unimodal function,f(x)
, over an interval, a<= x <=b. The algorithm calculates the number of iterations required to
insure the final interval is within the user-specified tolerance
